# Python-Decaying-Winter
A simplified version of the Roblox game "Decaying Winter" built completely using pygame and python.

Usage: Run "main.py". Works with any version of Python which is 3.6 or above.

A simplified survival game heavily based around Decaying Winter (https://www.roblox.com/games/9880062154/The-Last-Strandeds). Each night you have to go outside and search for scrap to improve your base at the end of the night. You then have to survive a horde of enemies. The game ends after you've survived all of the waves, or until you perish in the harsh winter.
